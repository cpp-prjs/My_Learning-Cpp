## Pointers
* #### Does *p++ increment p, or what it points to?
  The postfix ++ and -- operators essentially have higher precedence than the prefix unary operators. Therefore, *p++ is equivalent to *(p++); it increments p, and returns the value which p pointed to before p was incremented. To increment the value pointed to by p, use (*p)++ (or perhaps ++*p, if the evaluation order of the side effect doesn't matter).

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>

  int main() {
    int c = 3;		
    int* p = &c;		// `int` is of 4 bytes => a difference of 4 letters in hexadecimal

    std::cout << p << ": " << *p++ << std::endl;
    std::cout << p << ": " << ++*p << std::endl;
    return 0;
  }
  ```

  Output:
  ```
  0x61fec8: 3
  0x61fecc: 805331454
  ```
