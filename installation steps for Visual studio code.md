* ### Add the bin folder into Environment variables
  Here, the directory for 'bin' folder has to be added into environment variables, so that it can be accessed from command prompt.

* ### Visual studio code
  Open and install the following extension: <br/>
  **C/C++ â€“ IntelliSense, debugging, and code browsing for VS Code**

  ```c++
     #include <iostream>

     int main()
     {

        return 0;
     }
  ```
