* **Demerit of ```cin```**:
  takes 
  i. input as string only.
  ii. contnuous string as input, use alternative - ```getline```.
* **Pointer** - here, any pointer has stored values as address
  E.g. 
  ```
  int a = 5;  // variable stores the value
  int *ptr = nullptr;  // declared and initialised the pointer
  ptr = &a;   // the pointer stores the memory address of the variable.
  ```
