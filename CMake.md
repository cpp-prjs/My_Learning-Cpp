# CMake
## About
This is about learning how to compile C/C++ files:
* with independent platform support
* with external libraries

## Why this?
Usually, I choose to compile .cpp files with [CppFastOlympicCoding](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CppFastOlympicCoding) package. 
While using **Boost** library, it didn't require any linkage.

But while using [libXL](http://www.libxl.com/home.html), the existing package couldn't link the library. That's why I had to learn CMake.
